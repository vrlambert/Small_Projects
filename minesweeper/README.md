# Minesweeper played in the terminal
A simple minesweeper code, written in Python 2 and running in the terminal.


### Installation Instructions
Download the code and run in python 2 in a terminal. That's all it takes!

### Running Instructions
Play like normal minesweeper, but you have to make moves by entering them into
the terminal. The format for the move is 'm x y' (but without quotes)
where m is a move type and x and y are integers. m can be 'c' for click,
f for flag, or r for remove flag.

# Bugs:
- if an input doesn't have the proper format it crashes. This should be pretty easy to fix but it hasn't been done yet.

# TODO:
- Add difficulties
- Add game timer
